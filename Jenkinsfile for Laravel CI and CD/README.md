Below is a **simple and working Jenkinsfile** for **Laravel CI/CD using Docker Compose** ðŸš€
(Assuming Jenkins is installed with Docker + Docker Compose plugins and correct permissions).

---

### âœ… **Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)**

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_COMPOSE = "docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml"
    }

    stages {

        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://your-github-repo-url.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Containers') {
            steps {
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} build --no-cache"
            }
        }

        stage('Start Containers') {
            steps {
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} up -d"
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} exec app composer install"
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} exec app cp .env.example .env || true"
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} exec app php artisan key:generate"
            }
        }

        stage('Run Migrations') {
            steps {
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} exec app php artisan migrate --force"
            }
        }

        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} exec app php artisan test"
            }
        }

    }

    post {
        always {
            echo "Cleaning up containers..."
            sh "${DOCKER_COMPOSE} down"
        }
    }
}
```

### ðŸ“Œ What This Pipeline Does

| Stage                   | Description                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Clone Repository        | Pulls Laravel source            |
| Build Docker Containers | Builds app, web, db, phpmyadmin |
| Start Containers        | Launch stack in background      |
| Install Dependencies    | Composer install + env + key    |
| Run Migrations          | Applies DB structure            |
| Run Tests               | Runs Laravel tests              |
| Cleanup                 | Stops services after pipeline   |

### âœ… Requirements in Jenkins Server

Make sure Jenkins node has:

```bash
docker -v
docker-compose -v
```

Allow Jenkins to run Docker commands:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```

---

### âœ… Optional Deployment Stage

If you want deployment to a production server, tell me:
âœ… Hosting server?
âœ… Deployment path?
âœ… SSH credentials setup (Yes/No)?

---

If you want, I can also:
âœ… Set up automated builds on every Git push
âœ… Send notifications for failures
âœ… Add caching to speed up the pipeline
âœ… Deploy artifacts to production

Would you like me to include **Node build (npm install + Vite)** stage for frontend assets too?
